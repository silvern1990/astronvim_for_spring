## Bug ? 

After installing astrocommunity, when I opened some files using telescope(<Leader>ff),
I have a issue that I don't see which-key window.

This issue is temporarily resolved by deleting the ~/.local/state/nvim directory, but the same issue repeats.

Although it is cumbersome, to temporarily solve this issue in the editing session, you need to open another file or enter ex mode.
